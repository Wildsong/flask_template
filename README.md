# flask_template

This is a template for a Python flask app.

## Set up

```bash
conda create --name=flask --file=requirements.txt
conda activate flask
```

If all that went well you 
should now be able to open VSCode, hit F5,
and have the flask app launch in a debugger
and a browser window should open.
